# notes-web


I have taken inspiration of my design from: https://uidesigndaily.com/posts/photoshop-notes-widget-day-65 <br />
•You are able to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) a note. <br />
•Markdown has been used in this website. <br />
"(Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows us to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML))" <br />
•localStorage is used.<br />

<ul>
 "HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:<br />
     <li> 1.window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date <br /></li>
    <li> 2.window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)" <br /></li>
     </ul>
