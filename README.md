I have taken inspiration of my design from: https://uidesigndaily.com/posts/photoshop-notes-widget-day-65 <br />
   * You are able to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) a note. <br />
   * Markdown has been used in this website. <br />
   * Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows us to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to     structurally valid XHTML (or HTML) <br />
   * localStorage is used.<br />

 #### HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:
     1.window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date 
     2.window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)
