# notes-web


I have taken inspiration of my design from: https://uidesigndaily.com/posts/photoshop-notes-widget-day-65
•You are able to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) a note.
•Markdown has been used in this website.
"(Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows us to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML))"
•localStorage is used.
"HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:
     1.window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
     2.window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)"
